# 🐼 Pandas Playground

Welcome to **Pandas-Playground** – my ongoing journey of revisiting **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning fundamentals**, all through the power of **Jupyter Notebooks** and annotated with detailed **Markdown**!

> ⚡ This repo is currently active and reflects my real-time revision and learning progress!

## 🚀 What's Inside?

This is not just another pandas repo — it’s my **hands-on revision vault** where I break down concepts, code along, and explore patterns like a data detective 🕵️‍♂️.

### 📓 Core Topics Covered (So Far)
- ✅ Pandas Fundamentals  
- ✅ DataFrames & Series Deep Dive  
- ✅ Indexing, Filtering & Masking  
- ✅ Handling Missing Values  
- ✅ Merging, Joining, GroupBy  
- ✅ Descriptive Stats & Aggregations  
- ⏳ Upcoming: Scikit-Learn ML pipelines & EDA case studies  

> Each notebook is self-explanatory with inline markdown notes and visuals!
